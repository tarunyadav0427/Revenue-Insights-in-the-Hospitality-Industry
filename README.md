Working with AtliQ Grands, a renowned luxury hotel chain, we implemented "Business and Data Intelligence" strategies to revitalize their market share and revenue. Our primary task was to create a dynamic Power BI dashboard to glean insights from their historical data.

Key areas of focus included:
1. Developing an interactive Power BI dashboard for real-time data analysis.
2. Implementing crucial hospitality domain metrics like RevPAR, ADR, DBRN, DSRN, and DURN.
3. Analyzing historical data to uncover revenue-enhancing opportunities.
4. Providing actionable insights to guide pricing and occupancy decisions.

During this project, I acquired the following skills and knowledge:
1. Proficiency in Power BI for data visualization and analysis.
2. Deep understanding of key hospitality metrics and KPIs.
3. Data-driven decision-making for pricing and occupancy optimization.
4. Effective data presentation to aid in strategic decision-making.# Revenue-Insights-in-the-Hospitality-Industry
